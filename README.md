# Scrollytelling Template

## Getting started

```bash
cd team-7
npm install
```

You can then start a local development server to see live changes as you edit the template. It will run on <http://localhost:5000/> and should update every time you save changes to a file.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally. When you're done creating your project, you can compile it. (You'll find the compiled code in the `public` folder).

```bash
npm run build
```
